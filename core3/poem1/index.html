        FLAG <br> by John Agard 
        <br><br><br>
        What's that fluttering in a breeze? <br>
        It's just a piece of cloth <br>
        that brings a nation to its knees. <br><br>
        What's that unfurling from a pole? <br>
        It's just a piece of cloth <br>
        that makes the guts of men grow bold. <br><br>
        What's that rising over a tent? <br>
        It's just a piece of cloth<br>
        that dares the coward to relent.<br><br>
        What's that flying accross a field? <br>
        It's just a piece of cloth <br>
        that will outlive the blood you bleed.<br><br>
        How can I possess such a cloth? <br>
        Just ask for a flag my friend. <br>
        Then blind your conscience to the end.<br></div>
