    <h1>Matcha</h1>
    <p>Matcha[a] (抹茶, English: /ˈmætʃə, ˈmɑːtʃə/;[2][3]) is finely ground powder of specially grown and processed green tea leaves originating in China traditionally consumed in East Asia. It is mostly produced in Japan today.[4] The green tea plants used for matcha are shade-grown for three to four weeks before harvest; the stems and veins are removed during processing. During shaded growth, the plant Camellia sinensis produces more theanine and caffeine. The powdered form of matcha is consumed differently from tea leaves or tea bags, as it is suspended in a liquid, typically water or milk.</p>
    <p>        The traditional Japanese tea ceremony centers on the preparation, serving and drinking of matcha as hot tea, and embodies a meditative spirituality. In modern times, matcha is also used to flavor and dye foods such as mochi and soba noodles, green tea ice cream, matcha lattes and a variety of Japanese wagashi confectionery.</p>
      <h2> Definition</h2>
    <p> In Japan, labeling standards based on the Food Labeling Law (enacted in 2015) define which teas can be labeled and sold as matcha. According to it, matcha is defined as powdered tea made by grinding tea leaves, called tencha (碾茶), through a tea millstone to a fine powder.[5][6] Tencha refers to tea leaves grown under shade, steamed, and dried without kneading.</p>
    <p> In tencha, hard parts such as stems and veins are removed from the tea leaves. As a result, tencha has a rich aroma and a mild taste with little bitterness.</p>
    <p> High-grade matcha is ground using a special millstone, but it can also be labeled as matcha using an ordinary grinder.[6]    </p>
    <p> Sencha (煎茶), a popular green tea in Japan, has a process of kneading tea leaves in the manufacturing process, but matcha is not kneaded.
        <br>
        In the case of sencha, kneading the tea leaves destroys the cells and makes it easier for its ingredients to dissolve in (hot) water. Matcha, however, does not require kneading because the powder is dissolved directly in (hot) water. Because of this difference in production process, sencha and other green teas that are simply powdered cannot be sold as matcha in Japan. They are called powdered tea (粉末茶)[6] and sold as powdered green tea (粉末緑茶)[7] or instant tea (インスタント茶) in Japan.

        <h2> History</h2>
          <p> In China during the Tang dynasty (618–907), tea leaves were steamed and formed into compressed tea (tea bricks) for storage and trade. According to Lu Yu's The Classic of Tea (760-762), tea was first made by roasting compressed tea in solid form over a fire and then grinding it in a wooden grinder called a niǎn (碾, Japanese: yagen), then boiling water in a pot, adding salt when it boils, then adding the tea powder to the boiling water and boiling it until it foamed.[9][10] The tea was also sometimes mixed with green onions, ginger, jujubes, mandarin orange peels, Tetradium ruticarpum, and mint.[9]          </p>
          <p> During the Song dynasty (960–1279), the method of making powdered tea from steam-prepared dried tea leaves and preparing the beverage by whipping the tea powder and hot water together in a bowl became popular.[11]

            Although the term "matcha" (抹茶) is not used, powdered tea made with a tea whisk is believed to have originated in 10th century China. The most famous references to powdered tea are Cai Xiang's Record of Tea (1049-1053) and Emperor Huizong's Treatise on Tea (1107), both from the Song dynasty (960-1279).[12][13] According to these documents, high-grade lump tea (compressed tea), as typified by Lóngfèng Tuánchá (龍鳳團茶, lit. 'Dragon and Phoenix Lump Tea'), was ground to powder with a metal niǎn, then sifted, after which the powder was poured into a tea bowl, hot water was poured into the bowl, and the tea was prepared with a tea whisk.

          <p> According to the Record of Tea, the finer the sieve, the more the tea floats; the coarser the sieve, the more the tea sinks, so it seems that the particles of the powder were larger than those of modern matcha. The tea ceremonies at Kennin-ji Temple in Kyoto and Engaku-ji Temple in Kamakura are examples of the traditions of the Song dynasty.[14]
            </p>
          <p> The lump tea presented to the emperor was mixed with borneol, which had a strong aroma, and was coated with oil and fat flavoring to make the surface of the lump shiny, to the point that the tea's original aroma was extinguished. Cai Xiang criticized such processing.[12][13]

            The ideal color of tea was also considered white, not green or brown. However, since tea powder could not usually be made white, various processing methods had to be used to make it white. For example, tea buds were plucked when they had just sprouted and repeatedly squeezed, and water was added repeatedly to grind them. There was also a brand of white tea called "water buds" (水芽), in which the leafy part of the bud was removed and only the veins were used as raw material.[15]</p>
          <p> Thus, the complex manufacturing process of lump tea in the Song dynasty required a great deal of labor and money, and even the slightest fault during the process was enough to cause it to fail. Naturally, it was expensive and inaccessible to the common people. In the Tang dynasty, "bitter when sipped and sweet when swallowed" (The Classic of Tea) was considered ideal as the true taste of tea, but in the Song dynasty, it was forcibly changed to the four characteristics of "aroma, sweetness, richness, and smoothness" (Treatise on Tea), which was the ideal.[15] Thus, lump tea became an expensive and complicated processed tea in the Song dynasty, and some suggest that this was one of the reasons for its rapid decline after the Ming dynasty.[15]
