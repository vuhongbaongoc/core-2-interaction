        Let us begin with these I use the least first and these are colons and semi-colons, one might add to these commas.
      
      <p id="paragraph2"> When <br> I first began writing, <br> I felt that writing <br> should go on,<br> I still do feel that it <br>should go on <br> but when <br> I first began writing <br> I was completely possessed by the necessity that writing <br> should go on <br> and on <br> and if writing should <br> go on <br> what had colons and commas to do with it,<br>  what had periods to do with it <br> what had small letters and capitals to do with it <br> to do with writing <br> going on <br> which was at that time the most profound need I had in connection with writing. </p>
      <p id="paragraph3"> What had colons and <br> semi-colons <br> to do with it <br> what had commas <br> to do with it <br> what had periods <br> to do with it.
      <p id="paragraph4"> What had periods to do with it. </p>
      <p id="paragraph5"> Inevitably no matter how completely I had to have writing go on,<br>  physically <br>one had to <br> again and again stop sometime <br> and if one had to <br> again and again stop sometime<br>  and if one had to <br> again and again stop some time <br> then periods had to exist. </p>
      <p id="paragraph6"> Beside <br> I had always like the look of periods and <br> I liked what they did. <br><br> Stopping sometime did not really keep one from going on,<br> it was nothing that interfered, <br> it was only something that happened, <br> and as it happened as a perfectly natural happening, <br> I did not believe in periods <br> and I used them.
      <p id="paragraph7"> I really never stopped using them.    </p>
