    <p> What had periods to do with it.<br><br> Inevitably no matter how completely I had to have writing go on,<br>  physically <br>one had to <br> again and again stop sometime <br> and if one had to <br> again and again stop sometime<br>  and if one had to <br> again and again stop some time <br> then periods had to exist. <br><br> Beside <br> I had always like the look of periods and <br> I liked what they did. <br><br> Stopping sometime did not really keep one from going on,<br> it was nothing that interfered, <br> it was only something that happened, <br> and as it happened as a perfectly natural happening, <br> I did not believe in periods <br> and I used them.<br><br> I really never stopped using them.    </p>
