    <p> Beside that periods might later come <br> to have a life of their own <br> to commence breaking up things in arbitrary ways, <br> that has happened lately with me in a poem I have written called Winning His Way, <br> later I will read you a little of it. <br><br> By the time I had written this poem about three years ago <br> periods had come to have for me <br> completely a life of their own.<br><br>Theycould begin to act as <br> they thought best and <br> one might interrupt <br> one’s writing with them that is not really interrupt <br> one’s writing with them but <br> one could come to <br> stop arbitrarily <br> stop at times <br> in one’s writing <br> and so <br> they could be used <br> and you could use them. <br><br> Periods <br> could come to exist in this way <br> and they<br> could come in this way <br> to have a life of their own. <br> <br>They did not serve you in any servile way <br> as commas <br> and colons<br>  and semi-colons do. <br><br> Yes <br>you <br>do <br>feel <br>what <br>I<br> mean.</p>
    <p> Periods <br> have <br> a life of their own <br> a necessity of their own <br> a feeling of their own <br> a time of their own. <br><br> And <br> that feeling <br> that life <br> that necessity <br> that time can express itself in an infinite variety <br> that is the reason <br> that I have always remained true to periods so much so <br> that as I say recently I have felt <br> that one could need them more <br> than one had ever needed them.    </p>
