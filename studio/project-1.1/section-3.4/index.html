    <p>You can see what an entirely different thing <br> a period is <br> from a comma, <br> a colon or <br> a semi-colon.    </p>
    <p>There are two different way of thinking <br> about colons and semicolons <br> you can think of them as commas and as such <br>  they are purely servile or <br> you can think of them as periods <br> and then <br> using them can make you feel adventurous<br> I can see that one might feel about them as periods but I myself never have,<br>  I began unfortunately to feel them as a comma and commas are servile <br> they have no life of their own <br> they are dependent upon use and convenience and <br> they are put there just for practical purposes. <br><br> Semi-colons and colons had for me from the first completely <br> this character <br> the character <br> that a comma has and not the character that a period has <br> and therefore<br>  and definitely I have never used them.<br><br> But now <br> dimly <br> and <br> definitely <br> I do see that <br> they might well possibly <br> they might have in them something <br> of the character <br> of the period <br> and so <br> it might have been an adventure to use them. <br><br> I really do not think so.<br><br>  I think however lively <br> they are <br>or disguised <br> they are <br> they are definitely more comma than period and so really I cannot regret not having used them. <br><br> They are <br>more powerful <br> more imposing <br> more pretentious than a comma but <br> they are a comma all the same.<br><br> They really have <br> within them deeply <br> within them fundamentally <br> within them the comma nature.<br> And now <br> what does a comma do and<br> what has it to do and <br>  swhy do I feel as I do about them.      .</p>
