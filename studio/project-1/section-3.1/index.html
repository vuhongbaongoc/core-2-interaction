        Let us <span class="highlight"> <b> begin </b> </span> with these I use the least first and these are colons and semi-colons, one might add to these commas.
      
      <p id="paragraph2"> When <br> I first began writing, <br> I felt that writing <br> should <span class="highlight"> <b> go on,<br></b></span> I still do feel that it <br>should <span class="highlight"> <b> go on </b> </span> <br> but when <br> I first began writing <br> I was completely possessed by the necessity that writing <br> should <span class="highlight"> <b> go on </b> </span> <br> and on <br> and if writing should <br> <span class="highlight"> <b> go on </b> </span><br> what had colons and commas to do with it,<br>  what had periods to do with it <br> what had small letters and capitals to do with it <br> to do with writing <br> <span class="highlight"> <b> going on </b></span><br> which was at that time the most profound need I had in connection with writing. </p>
      <p id="paragraph3"> What had colons and <br> semi-colons <br>  <span class="highlight"> <b> to do with it </b></span><br> what had commas <br> <span class="highlight"> <b>  to do with it </b></span> <br> what had periods <br>  <span class="highlight"> <b> to do with it.</b> </span>
      <p id="paragraph4"> What had periods  <span class="highlight"> <b>to do with it. </b> </span></p>
      <p id="paragraph5"> Inevitably no matter how completely I had to have writing  <span class="highlight"> <b> go on, </b> </span><br>  physically <br>one had to <br> <span class="highlight"> <b>again and again</b></span> stop sometime <br> and if one had to <br> <span class="highlight"> <b>again and again </b></span>stop sometime<br>  and if one had to <br> <span class="highlight"> <b>again and again</b></span> stop some time <br> then periods had to exist. </p>
      <p id="paragraph6"> Beside <br> I had always like the look of periods and <br> I liked what they did. <br><br> Stopping sometime did not really keep one from  <span class="highlight"> <b>going on, </b> </span><br> it was nothing that interfered, <br> it was only something that happened, <br> and as it happened as a perfectly natural happening, <br> I did not believe in periods <br> and I used them.
      <p id="paragraph7"> I really <span class="highlight"> <b>never stopped</b></span> using them.    </p>
      <p id="paragraph8"> Beside that periods might later come <br> to have a <span class="highlight"> <b>life of their own </b> </span> <br> to commence breaking up things in arbitrary ways, <br> that has happened lately with me in a poem I have written called Winning His Way, <br> later I will read you a little of it. 
      <p id="paragraph9"> By the time I had written this poem about three years ago <br> periods had come to have for me <br> completely<span class="highlight"> <b> a life of their own. </b> </span>
      <p id="paragraph10">They could begin to act as <br> they thought best and <br> one might interrupt <br> one’s writing with them that is not really interrupt <br> one’s writing with them but <br> one could come to <br> stop arbitrarily <br> stop at times <br> in one’s writing <br> and so <br> they could be used <br> and you could use them. 
      <p id="paragraph11"> Periods <br> could come to <span class="highlight"> <b> exist in this way </b></span><br> and they<br> could <span class="highlight"> <b> come in this way </b></span> <br>  to have a life of their own.
      <p id="paragraph12"> They did not serve you in any servile way <br> as commas <br> and colons<br>  and semi-colons do.
      <p id="paragraph13"> Yes you do feel what I mean. </p>
