            Transcription by Heather Wang <br>
            <br><br>
            Krista Tippett, host:<br>
                The late poet Mary Oliver is among the most beloved writers of modern times. Amidst the harshness 
                of life, she found redemption in the natural world and in beautiful, precise language. She sat with me 
                for a rare intimate conversation, and we offer it up anew as nourishment for now.
                <br><br>
                [music: “Seven League Boots” by Zoë Keating]
                <br><br>
            Mary Oliver:<br>
                “Whoever you are, no matter how lonely, / the world offers itself to your imagination, / calls to you 
                like the wild geese, harsh and exciting—/ over and over announcing your place / in the family of things.”
                <br><br>
            Tippett:<br>
                I’m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being.
                Mary Oliver was born in 1935 and grew up in a small town in Ohio. In her later years she spoke openly of 
                profound abuse she suffered as a child. She won the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, among 
                her many honors, and published numerous collections of poetry and, also, some wonderful prose. She 
                lived and wrote for five decades on Cape Cod. I met with her in Florida in 2015, where she spent the last 
                few years of her life.
                The question I always start with, whether I’m interviewing a physicist or a poet, is I’d like to hear whether 
                there was a spiritual background to your life—to your early life, to your childhood—however you would 
                define that now.
                <br><br>  
            Oliver:<br>
                Well, I would define it, now, very differently from when I was a child. I was sent to Sunday school, as 
                many kids are, and then I had trouble with the resurrection, so I would not join the church. But I was 
                still probably more interested than many of the kids who did enter the church. It’s been one of the most 
                important interests of my life, and continues to be. And it doesn’t have to be Christianity; I’m very much 
                taken with the poet Rumi, who is Muslim, a Sufi poet, and read him every day. And I have no answers, but 
                have some suggestions. I know that a life is much richer with a spiritual part to it. And I also think nothing 
                is more interesting. So I cling to it.
                <br><br> 
            Tippett:<br>
                And then you talk about growing up in a sad, depressed place, a difficult place. You don’t belabor this, 
                I mean, and in other places—there’s a place you talk about you were one of many thousands who’ve had 
                insufficient childhoods, but that you spent a lot of your time walking around the woods in Ohio.
                <br><br>
            Oliver:<br>
                Yes, I did, and I think it saved my life. To this day, I don’t care for the enclosure of buildings. It was a very 
                bad childhood—for everybody, every member of the household, not just myself, I think—and I escaped it, 
                barely, with years of trouble. But I did find the entire world, in looking for something. But I got saved by 
                poetry, and I got saved by the beauty of the world.
                <br><br>
            Tippett:<br>
                And there’s such a convergence of those things then, it seems, all the way through, in your life as a poet.
                <br><br>  
            Oliver:<br>
                Yes, it is. It is a convergence. And I have a little difficulty now, having lived for 50 years in a small town in 
                the North—I’m trying very hard to love the mangroves. [laughs] It takes a while.
                <br><br>
            Tippett:<br>
                Well, I know. I have to say, you and your poetry, for me, are so closely identified with Provincetown a
                nd that part of the world and that kind of dramatic weather, that kind of shore. And so when I had this 
                amazing opportunity to come visit you—and I said, Oh great, we’re going to Cape Cod! No, we’re going to 
                Florida. [laughs]
                <br><br>
            Oliver:<br>
                Yes, I just sold my condo to a very dear friend, this summer, and I bought a little house down here, 
                which needs very serious reconstruction, so I’m not in it yet. But sometimes, it’s time for the change.
                <br><br>
            Tippett:<br>
                Though for all those years, for decades of your writing, this picture was there of you, this pleasure of 
                walking and writing and, I don’t know, standing with your notebook and actually writing while you’re walking. 
                <br><br>
            Oliver:<br>
                Yes, that’s how I did it.
                <br><br>
            Tippett:<br>
                And it is. And it seems like such a gift, that you found that way to be a writer and to have that daily—have 
                a ritual of writing.
                <br><br>
            Oliver:<br>
                Well, as I say, I don’t like buildings. The only record I broke in school was truancy. I went to the woods a 
                lot, with books—Whitman in the knapsack—but I also liked motion. So I just began with these little 
                notebooks and scribbled things as they came to me, and then worked them into poems, later.
                And always, I wanted the “I.” Many of the poems are: I did this, I did this, I saw this. I wanted the “I” to be 
                the possible reader, rather than about myself. It was about an experience that happened to be mine, but could 
                well have been anybody else’s. And that was my feeling about the “I.” I have been criticized by one editor, who 
                felt that the “I” would be felt as ego, and I thought, No, well, I’m going to risk it and see. And I think it worked. 
                It enjoined the reader into the experience of the poem. I became the kind of person who did the walking and the 
                scribbling, but shared it if they wanted it. Yes.
                <br><br>
            Tippett:<br>
                And you also use this word—there’s this place where you’re talking about writing while walking, listening deeply, 
                and—I love this—“listening convivially” …
                <br><br>
            Oliver:<br>
                [laughs] Yes. Yeah.
                <br><br>
            Tippett:<br>
                … and listening, really, to the world.
                <br><br>
            Oliver:<br>
                Listening to the world. Well, I did that, and I still do it. I still do it.
                <br><br>
            Tippett:<br>
                I was going to ask you if you thought you could have been a poet in an age when you probably would have grown 
                up writing on computers.
                <br><br>
            Oliver:<br>
                Oh, now? Oh, I very much advise writers not to use a computer.
                <br><br>
            Tippett:<br>
                But it seems to me that more than the computer being the problem, the sitting at a desk would be a problem.
                <br><br>
            Oliver:<br>
                That’s a problem; lots of things are problems. As I talk about it in the Poetry Handbook, discipline is very 
                important. The habit—I think we’re creative all day long. We have to have an appointment, to have that work 
                out on the page, because the creative part of us gets tired of waiting, or just gets tired. And It’s helped a 
                lot of students, young poets, doing that—to have that meeting with that part of oneself, because there are, 
                of course, other parts of life.
                I used to say I gave my—when I had jobs, which wasn’t that often. But I’d say: I give my very best, 
                second-class labor to the—
                <br><br>
            Tippett:<br>
                To the job.
                <br><br>
            Oliver:<br>
                Because I’d get up at 5, and by 9, I’d already had my say.
                <br><br>
            Tippett:<br>
                And also, when you write about that, the discipline that creates space for something quite mysterious to happen, 
                you talk about that “wild, silky part of ourselves.” You talk about the “part of the psyche that works in concert 
                with consciousness and supplies a necessary part of the poem—a heart of the star as opposed to the shape of the 
                star, let us say—exists in a mysterious, unmapped zone: not unconscious, not subconscious, but cautious.”
                <br><br> 
            Oliver:<br>
                What is that from?
                <br><br>
            Tippett:<br>
                That’s from the Poetry Handbook. [laughs]
                <br><br>
            Oliver:<br>
                [laughs] It’s been awhile.
                <br><br>
            Tippett:<br>
                It’s great. But you say, you promise—it learns quickly what sort of courtship it’s going to be. You’re saying 
                the writer has to be kind of in courtship with this elusive, essential but elusive, cautious—you say “cautious”—part, 
                and that if you turn up every day, it will learn to trust you.
                <br><br> 
            Oliver:<br>
                Yes, yes, yes. I remember that.
                <br><br>
            Tippett:<br>
                This is a very practical way about talking about something that’s quite—
                <br><br>
            Oliver:
                Trust is very important.
                <br><br>
            Tippett:<br>
                Yes, and that’s the creative process.
                <br>
            Oliver:<br>
                That is the creative process. It’s also true that I believe poetry—it is a convivial, and a kind of—it’s very old. 
                It’s very sacred. It wishes for a community—it’s a community ritual, certainly. And that’s why, when you write a poem, 
                you write it for anybody and everybody. And you have to be ready to do that out of your single self. It’s a giving. It’s 
                always—it’s a gift. It’s a gift to yourself, but it’s a gift to anybody who has a hunger for it.
                <br><br>
            Tippett:<br>
                And I wonder if it’s something about this process you describe, where you’ve applied the will, but also the discipline, 
                to reach and, also, make room for something that’s very deep in us, right? I mean, I love this language, “this wild, silky 
                part of ourselves.” I don’t know—maybe the soul.
                <br><br>
            Oliver:<br>
                It’s become a nasty word, lately …
                <br><br>
            Tippett:<br>
                I know it has.
                <br><br>
            Oliver:<br>
                … because it’s used—it’s become a lazy word. It’s too bad.
                <br><br>
            Tippett:<br>
                It’s cliched.
                <br><br>
            Oliver:<br>
                Overused.
                <br><br>
            Tippett:<br>
                So “the silky part”—let’s just call it that. But I mean, when you offer that—I mean, poetry does create a way to offer that, 
                in a condensed form, vivid form.
                <br><br>
            Oliver: <br>
                Yes. And very often—you know, it was Blake who said, “I take dictation.” With that discipline and with that willingness 
                and wish to communicate, very often things very slippery do come in that you weren’t planning on receiving them. But they 
                do happen. I have very rarely, maybe four or five times in my life, I’ve written a poem that I never changed, and I don’t 
                know where it came from. But it does happen. But it happens among hundreds of poems that you’ve struggled over.
                <br><br>
            Tippett:<br>
                Do you know which—do you know what some of those are? Do you know what they are now, still?
                <br><br>
            Oliver:<br>
                Well, the Percy one was one—“The First Time Percy Came Back.” I never changed a word of that. And there are others. I 
                can’t remember, but there are a few. Of course, there are also poems that I just write out and then I throw them out—[laughs] 
                lots of those.
                <br><br>
            Tippett:<br>
                Well, and also, when you talk about this life of waking up in the morning and being outside, in this wild landscape, and with 
                your notebook in your hand and walking—it’s so enviable, right? But then I know, when you’re—in the Poetry Handbook, 
                there’s the discipline of being there, but there’s also the hard work of rewriting, and as you say, some things have to be t
                hrown out.
                <br><br>
            Oliver:<br>
                Oh, many, many, many have to be thrown out, for sure.
                <br><br>
            Tippett:<br>
                There’s an unromantic part to the process, as well.
                <br><br>
            Oliver:<br>
                Well, that’s an interesting word. Somebody once wrote about me and said I must have a private grant or something; that all I 
                seem to do is walk around the woods and write poems. But I was very, very poor, and I ate a lot of fish, ate a lot of clams.
                <br><br>
            Tippett:<br>
                Right. And I read that you weren’t just walking around the woods, you were gathering food, in those early years: mussels 
                and clams and mushrooms and berries. Although you gave voice to this really lavish, even ornate beauty that you lived in …
                <br><br>
            Oliver:<br>
                That’s how I saw it.
                <br><br>
            Tippett:<br>
                … that was your daily—that was really your mundane world.
                <br><br>
            Oliver:<br>
                Yes, that’s true.
                <br><br>
            Tippett:<br>
                So there’s a question that you pose in many different ways, overtly and implicitly: How shall I live? In Long Life, you wrote, 
                “What does it mean that the earth is so beautiful? And what shall I do about it? What is the gift that I should bring to the 
                world? What is the life that I should live?”—which really is a question of moral imagination, and it’s the ancient, essential 
                question. But I wonder how you think about how that question emerges and is addressed distinctively, in poetry and through poetry. 
                What does poetry do with a question like that that other forms of language don’t?
                <br><br>
            Oliver:<br>
                Well, I think I would disagree that other forms of language don’t, but poetry has a different kind of attraction.
                <br><br>
            Tippett:<br>
                So what is that attraction in poetry?
                <br><br>
            Oliver:<br>
                I think it’s the way it’s written. It’s the fact that it has been communal, for years and years and years, and we’ve missed it. 
                But I do think poetry has enticements of sound that are different from literature—literature certainly has it, too, or some 
                literature, the best literature—and it’s easier for people to remember. People are more apt to remember a poem, and therefore 
                feel they own it and can speak it to themselves as you might a prayer, than they can remember a chapter and quote it. And that’s 
                very important, because then it belongs to you. You have it when you need it.<br>
                But poetry is certainly closer to singing than prose. And singing is something that we all love to do or wish we could do. [laughs]
                <br><br>
            Tippett:<br>
                And it goes all the way through you.
                <br><br>
            Oliver:<br>
                Yes. It does indeed.
